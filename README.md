AZURE Devops - Docker / Kubernetes
how to connect GitHub repository with Azure DevOps (ADO) — an essential setup for enabling automation, pipelines, and collaborative workflows.

What is Azure DevOps (ADO)?
Azure DevOps (ADO) is a cloud platform from Microsoft that helps you manage your software development lifecycle, including:
Boards: Agile project tracking
Repos: Git repositories (optional if you’re using GitHub)
Pipelines: CI/CD automation
Test Plans: Manual and automated testing
Artifacts: Package sharing

Why Set This Up?
Many teams keep their source code in GitHub, but use Azure DevOps for:
Project tracking (Boards)
CI/CD automation (Pipelines)
Enterprise-level visibility & control

Connecting GitHub to ADO lets you:
Automatically build/test/deploy when code changes
Manage releases and monitor them in one place
Combine GitHub collaboration with Azure’s DevOps power

Step-by-Step: Connect GitHub to Azure DevOps
Step 1: Sign in to Azure DevOps
 Step 2: Create an Azure DevOps Organization
 What is an Organization in ADO?
An organization is the top-level container in Azure DevOps. It’s like a company or team space where all your projects live.

Why It Matters:
Helps organize multiple teams or departments
Centralizes access control and billing
Separates environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod)
